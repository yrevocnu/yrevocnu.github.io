        <p>We are a community that gathers to assist each other in our creative goals.</p>
        <p>We are an EdTech hacker collective.</p>
        <p>We are artists or people who would have been artists if we hadn't gone to grad school.</p>
        <p>We are creating a museum bazaar in the virtual and augmented realities.</p>
        <p>We are the universe uncovering itself.</p>
        <p>We are an unarmed militia.</p>
        <p>We are launching a culture that is an alternative.</p>

        <h1>Events</h1>
        <p>We play a game like Calvinball or Nomic to bootstrap a new society.</p>
        <p>We act like a Burning Man camp that always builds up and never burns down.</p>
        <p>We come with skills to teach and ideas to manifest.</p>
        <p>The next <strong>Future Ball</strong> is coming November 2018 in Pittsburgh, PA.</p>
        <p>It will be unlike any that have come before it.</p>
