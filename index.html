        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>We are a community that gathers to assist each other in our creative goals.</p>
        <p>We are launching a new, alternative culture.</p>
        <p>We are the universe uncovering itself.</p>
        <p>We are an unarmed militia.</p>
        <p>We are an EdTech hacker collective.</p>
        <p>We are creating a museum bazaar in the virtual and augmented realities.</p>

        <div class="box">
          <p>The 2nd triannual</p>
          <h3>Future Ball</h3>
          <p>celebrates <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Guy-Fawkes-Day">Guy Fawkes Day</a></p>
          <p>Nov 2-5, 2018</p>
          <p>at Cult HQ, in Pittsburgh, PA.</p>
        </div>

        <p>We accomplish our vision through events.</p>
        <p>They are opportunities to share skills with each other through creative play.</p>
        <p>They are opportunities to make and create something.</p>
        <p>They are opportunities to shape the future of our community.</p>
        <p>They are loosely structured, imagined as an <a href="https://www.aleph.se/Trans/Cultural/Philosophy/infinitegames.html">infinite game</a>, with flexible rules like <a href="https://cf.geekdo-images.com/imagepagezoom/img/f48jokMCs1hrr0-jQAcRCJcfwpM=/fit-in/1200x900/filters:no_upscale()/pic1815571.jpg">Calvinball</a> or <a href="https://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/nomic.htm">Nomic</a>.</p>
        <p>Currently the events are invitation-only. We select for great people who we think have something to learn from each other.</p>.
