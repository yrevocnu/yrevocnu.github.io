        <h1>Vision</h1>
        <p>We are a community that gathers to assist each other in our creative goals.</p>
        <p>We are an EdTech hacker collective.</p>
        <p>We are artists or people who would have been artists if we hadn't gone to grad school.</p>
        <p>We are creating a museum bazaar in the virtual and augmented realities.</p>
        <p>We are the universe uncovering itself.</p>
        <p>We are an unarmed militia.</p>
        <p>We are launching a culture that is an alternative.</p>
        <p>We aim for meaningful impact in the real estate market.</p>

        <h1>Events</h1>
        <p>We accomplish our vision through events.</p>
        <p>They are opportunities to share skills with each other through creative play.</p>
        <p>They are opportunities to make and create something.</p>
        <p>They are opportunities to shape the future of our community.</p>
        <p>They are loosely structured, imagined as an <a href="https://www.aleph.se/Trans/Cultural/Philosophy/infinitegames.html">infinite game</a>, with flexible rules like <a href="https://cf.geekdo-images.com/imagepagezoom/img/f48jokMCs1hrr0-jQAcRCJcfwpM=/fit-in/1200x900/filters:no_upscale()/pic1815571.jpg">Calvinball</a> or <a href="https://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/nomic.htm">Nomic</a>.</p>
        <p>Currently the events are invitation-only. We select for great people who we think have something to learn from each other.</p>.
        <p></p>.
        <p>The next <strong>Future Ball</strong> is coming November 2018 in Pittsburgh, PA.</p>
        <p>It will be unlike any that have come before it.</p>
