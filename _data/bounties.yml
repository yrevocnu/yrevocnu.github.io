  long: A person who actively wants to achieve something with Yrevocnu members at
    the Future Ball, such as learning and/or teaching something at an introductory
    level, after having had their recruiter explain their Yrevocnu experiences. If
    multiple individuals fulfill this requirement, preference will go to collaborations
    with specific existing members (which may include the recruiter). In other words,
    bringing a buddy you want to do something with is an ideal example.
