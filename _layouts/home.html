        <p>We accomplish our vision through events.</p>
        <p>They are opportunities to share skills with each other through creative play.</p>
        <p>They are opportunities to make and create something.</p>
        <p>They are opportunities to shape the future of our community.</p>
        <p>They are loosely structured, imagined as an <a href="https://www.aleph.se/Trans/Cultural/Philosophy/infinitegames.html">infinite game</a>, with flexible rules like <a href="https://cf.geekdo-images.com/imagepagezoom/img/f48jokMCs1hrr0-jQAcRCJcfwpM=/fit-in/1200x900/filters:no_upscale()/pic1815571.jpg">Calvinball</a> or <a href="https://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/nomic.htm">Nomic</a>.</p>
        <p>Currently the events are invitation-only. We select for great people who we think have something to learn from each other.</p>
