          <h2>Vision</h2>
          <p>We are a community that gathers to assist each other in our creative goals.</p>
          <p>Founded in 2018, Yrevocnu is an autopoietic process running on a distributed network of sociotechnical resources. Designed with ideas drawn from Gunther Taubner, Mirielle Hildbebrandt, Francisco Varela, and Seymour Pappert, Yrevocnu harnesses artists, engineers, scholars, executives, and spiritualists into an infinite game. It defines an ongoing "space" for intimate, provocative engagement. Triannual Events for communal renewal and integration punctuate an ongoing creation, curation, and collaboration between members whose current affiliations include Cornell Tech’s Digital Life Initiative, Carnegie Mellon University’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute, St. Michael’s College at the University of Toronto, New York University’s Information Law Institute, and the Wharton School of Business.</p>

          <p>We accomplish our vision through events.</p>
          <p>They are opportunities to share skills with each other through creative play.</p>
          <p>They are opportunities to make and create something.</p>
          <p>They are opportunities to shape the future of our community.</p>
          <p>They are loosely structured, imagined as an <a href="https://www.aleph.se/Trans/Cultural/Philosophy/infinitegames.html">infinite game</a>, with flexible rules like <a href="https://cf.geekdo-images.com/imagepagezoom/img/f48jokMCs1hrr0-jQAcRCJcfwpM=/fit-in/1200x900/filters:no_upscale()/pic1815571.jpg">Calvinball</a> or <a href="https://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/nomic.htm">Nomic</a>.</p>
          <p>Currently the events are invitation-only. We select for great people who we think have something to learn from each other.</p>
