Yrevocnu Event 5 has begun.

**Logistics**

Because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we are experimenting
with a different format for Event 5.

Event 5 has begun on-line, initiated by playing
_Psychdelic Glass Bead Game_ (PGBG), our flagship creative ideation
process.

Event 5 will end at some time when it is ethically
possible to meet in a large in-person gathering.
At that time, we will hold a party to celebrate and initiate new
members.

**Three stories**

PGBG, modeled on the Glass Bead Game from Hermann Hesse's eponymous
novel, is an evolving process by which Yrevocnu draws inspiration
from our collective superconsciousness, considering our life
experience and cultural context.

At the opening of Event 5, we used a new variation of the tarot
card version of PGBG. We collectively drew cards into an
original tarot spread designed for generating narratives.
The spread was divided into two fields: a Protagonist, and
the Antagonist. Each of these had a field to define their
Character, a field for their Friends, a field for their Fate,
and a field for an Event in the story. There was also a
field for "the Football", the focus of the conflict between the
two main characters. In one case there was also a field for
the Resolution fo the conflict.

There were three draws:

**Competition**

The Organizer of Event 5 has opened a competition!

The competition is to create the best story (in any medium)
inspired by each game.

The creator(s) of the three winning stories--the best stories
corresponding to each game--will win â‚·1 each.
