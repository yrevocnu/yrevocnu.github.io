<h3>Location</h3>

In the program, rooms are designated with hashtags.

Registered attendees will be given a map that hyperlinks the hashtags to the URLs where the activity takes place.

We ask that as much as possible, people access the Grey House room from the corresponding room wherever they are physically sheltering-in-place.

<em>Example: Natalie decides to prepare a meal. She does so in her physical kitchen. While there, she directs her laptop browser to the URL corresponding the the hashtag #kitchen. She finds a video chat room with other attendees, also cooking or chatting from their kitchens.</em>

<h3>Questions</h3>

If you have any administrative questions during the event, please consult the event staff in the #library.
