Due to the unprecedented COVID-19 situation, Yrevocnu is organizing the Future Ball (Event 4) as a virtual house party available to those who are sheltering-in-place.

The Event will take place "in" a collection of virtual rooms connecting real, physical rooms: the Grey House.

All times are in ET time zone.

If you are unable to attend for the whole event, we invite the interested public to our <strong>Opening Ceremonies</strong> and <strong></strong>

<h3>Location</h3>

In the program, rooms are designated with hashtags.

Registered attendees will be given a map that hyperlinks the hashtags to the URLs where the activity takes place.

We ask that as much as possible, people access the Grey House room from the corresponding room wherever they are physically sheltering-in-place.

<em>Example: Natalie decides to prepare a meal. She does so in her physical kitchen. While there, she directs her laptop browser to the URL corresponding the the hashtag #kitchen. She finds a video chat room with other attendees, also cooking or chatting from their kitchens.</em>

<h3>Questions</h3>

If you have any administrative questions during the event, please consult the event staff in the #back-office.
