Psychedelic Glass Bead Game, Yrevoncu's version of the Glass Bead Game, is an evolving product.
The rules described in this post are from its manifestation during Event 5, which ran for several
months before culminating in a live gathering.

<h3>Board</h3>
<p>The board helps structure the story. It has distinct spaces for the distinct parts of a story.</p>
<ul class="list-none">
  <li>Protagonist</li>
  <li>Protagonists helper</li>
  <li>Antagonist</li>
  <li>Antagonists Helper</li>
  <li>The Football (Central Plot Conflict)</li>
  <li>Plot Twist</li>
  <li>Conclusion</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3>Decks</h3>
  <p>Any combination and number of decks can be used, but it tends to be easiest to stick to one deck. 5 Decks have
    been digitized they are:</p>
  <ul class="list-none">
    <li>Toth</li>
    <li>Rider Wait</li>
    <li>Jung</li>
    <li>Chaos Deck</li>
    <li>Yrevocnu's own deck...</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each deck has its own flavor.</p>

  <hr />

<h3>Play</h3>
  <ol class="text-left">
    <li>Each player draws a card</li>
    <li>Players go in voluntary order</li>
    <li>Each player plays a until <em>n-1</em> (where n is the number of spaces on the board) spaces on the board are filled
    </li>
    <li>Playing the last space is optional</li>
    <li>When a card is played, the player has to explain that part of the story based on the meaning of the card.
      The
      player has wide liberty to associate their new story element to the card. As a starting place, the cards come
      with a suggested meaning when drawn, but you can invent your own.</li>
    <li>No player can go a second time, until each player has gone</li>
    <li>Players and audience are encouraged to actively discuss the story throughout play</li>
  </ol>

  <hr />

  <h3>Scoring</h3>

  <p>Scoring doesn't actually exist, but if it did higher scores would go to the most coherent and aesthetically
    pleasing stories that make use of the cards. Bonus points at the end go to:</p>

  <ul class="list-none">
    <li>Tying the story to the plot of a movie, show, book or other generally known work of fiction</li>
    <li>Demonstrating resemblance to actual events, current or historical</li>
    <li>Identifying with story by telling how the board pertains to one's own life</li>
  </ul>
